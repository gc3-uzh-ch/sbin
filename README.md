Miscellaneous Linux systems administration utilities
----------------------------------------------------

These are utilities and scripts written to help daily sysadmin chores
at the [GC3](http://www.gc3.uzh.ch).  

They are distributed here in the hope they will be useful to others
too.  If you use, extend, or patch any of the scripts in this
directory, [we would love to hear from you](mailto:sysadmin@gc3.lists.uzh.ch) 
and incorporate the patch.
